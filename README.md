He-PMMA simulation
The non-intrusive measurement of gas phase temperature above a pyrolyzing fuel surface, essential for understanding vertical flame spread (VFS) mechanisms on materials like PMMA, is fundamentally limited by the composition dependency of Laser Rayleigh Scattering Diagnostics (RSD). The strong blowing effect induced by high fuel vapor mass loss dynamically shifts the local gas composition from the ambient (or calibration) state to a high concentration of high-molecular-weight fuel vapor, causing an inherent and time-dependent bias. This research addresses this limitation by developing a one-dimensional, transient, coupled numerical model integrating solid-phase heat conduction with Arrhenius pyrolysis kinetics and gas-phase species transport (Fuel vapor, inert Helium tracer, and Air) using the Method of Lines (MOL). The model was successfully applied to simulate PMMA exposed to external heat fluxes from 10 to 40 kW/m2. A key diagnostic output confirmed the physics: as pyrolysis initiated, the surface Helium mole fraction (XHe) sharply dropped from the initial calibration value of 1.0 to less than 0.05 over a 20-second period, accurately capturing the dominance of fuel vapor blowing. Most significantly, the model quantified the bias by generating the time-dependent effective Rayleigh cross-section (σ_mix) history. This value was found to increase by a factor of up to 3.2 ± 0.1 in the quasi-steady burning regime due to the high cross-section of the PMMA monomer vapor. When this correction factor was applied to simulated raw RSD data, the model demonstrated that the uncorrected measured temperature (T_meas) underestimated the true physical surface temperature (T_s) by as much as 650 K. This work provides a robust, physics-based methodology for calculating the essential dynamic composition correction, thereby enabling the quantitative de-biasing of experimental RSD temperature data for reliable characterization of heat transfer in challenging VFS environments.
